# Overview
In anticipation of opening a surf/ice cream shop in Hawaii, this analysis was used to assess temperatures in both Summer and Winter from 2010 to 2017 to support the viability of a year-round business. 

# Results
Below are summary statistics for temperatures in June and December:

### Based on these summaries we can make a few key determinations:
- The first is that temperatures are only marginally lower in December than in June, which bodes well for both ice cream sales and surfing.
- The std deviation in both months is about the same, bewteen 2-4 degrees, which means temperatures are relatively stable in both June and December.
- Min and max temps are also relatively similar between the June and december, which again supports the notion that weather patterns remain stable in both summer and winter months.

# Summary

Based on this analysis, investors can feel confident that an ice-cream/surf shop is viable year-round in this climate. However, it's worth noting that these summaries only focus on temperature. Things like precipitation and tropical storms can also affect a business that is heavily dependent on temperate weather. To that end, we can write some additional code that queries and summarizes precipitation data for the months of June and December:<br/>

We could even go a step further and show average temps and average precipitation for each month in a given year. This will give us a better picture of how precipitation and temperature flunctate annually. For this, we'll choose the most recent year available, 2016:<br/><br/>

From these tables, we can see that January, February, and March are actually the coldest monthsâ€“not December. However, temperatures and precipitation levels remain favorable and fairly stable for the vast majority of the year. With this, investors can feel confident that this type of business fits the climate in this area.
